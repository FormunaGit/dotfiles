# Formuna's Dotfiles!
Hey there, came to copy my dots? I'd rather you copy from [N3RDIUM's](https://github.com/N3RDIUM/Zenith) since 90% of mine are from him.

## How do I install this?
These dotfiles are easily installable as a system flake, so the process to install it on a NixOS system is pretty easy:

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/FormunaGit/dotfiles`
2. Delete the /etc/nixos folder with `sudo rm -rf /etc/nixos` (**WARNING: this will remove any configs you have in configuration.nix**)
3. Symlink the `dotfiles` folder to /etc/nixos with `sudo ln -s ./dotfiles/ /etc/nixos/`

## What's it look like?
As of `February 13, 2025` (1 day before Pi day!), it looks like this:
